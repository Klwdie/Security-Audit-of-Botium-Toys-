# Security Audit of Botium Toys

---

Botium Toys (**a fictional company**) found itself at risk through noncompliance and inadequate security controls. Their scope was to assess all assets alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices. Their goal was then to assess existing assets and complete the **controls and compliance checklist** to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toysâ€™ security posture. 

This repository includes the Botium Toys scope, goals, and risk assessment report, control categories, and *controls and compliance checklist*. The control and compliance checklist contains all related information including all recommendations to improve Botium Toys' security posture as well as adhere to compliance and security best practices (**SOC type 1, SOC type 2, GDPR, and PCI-DSS**).
