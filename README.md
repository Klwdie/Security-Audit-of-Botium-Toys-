# Security Audit of Botium Toys'

---

Botium Toys' (**a fictional company**) found itself at risk through noncompliance and inadequate security controls. Their scope was to assess all assets alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices. Their goal was then to assess existing assets and complete the **controls and compliance checklist** to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toysâ€™ security posture. This repository includes the *controls and compliance checklist* and within it, all related information.

[Controls and compliance checklist](https://github.com/Klwdie/Security-Audit-of-Botium-Toys-/blob/main/Controls%20and%20compliance%20checklist.pdf)

This includes all recommendations to improve Botium Toys' security posture as well as adhere to compliance best practices (**SOC type 1, SOC type 2, GDPR, and PCI-DSS**).
